Fourth: Communicate with Stakeholders

Construct an email or slack message that is understandable to a product or business leader who isnâ€™t familiar with your day to day work. 
This part of the exercise should show off how you communicate and reason about data with others. 
Commit your answers to the git repository along with the rest of your exercise.

1.What questions do you have about the data?
Where the data comes from and what is the data source?
Who need the data analysis result and what is the goal of the data analysis?

2.How did you discover the data quality issues?
I did some data explore analysis in notebook by using python script. First I tranfer the json file to a dataframe data structure which is 
easier for me to debug the issue in the data. Then by understanding the meaning the column, I did some analysis to check if there is some 
data that have conflcits. For example, if the rewardsReceiptStatus is 'REJECTED' then there should not exist pointsAwardedDate. And for each
receipt, the sum of the quantityPurchased of all th items under that receipt should equal to the total purchasedItemCount.

3.What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?
I need to for those conflict issues in the data, which one is correct. For example, if the rewardsReceiptStatus is 'REJECTED' but there also 
exist a specific pointsAwardedDate. Is the rewardsReceiptStatus is wrong or pointsAwardedDate is wrong. I may need to do some deep dive
analysis and communicate with the stackholders to understand it.

4.What other information would you need to help you optimize the data assets you're trying to create?
I need more details about the features in receipts table. There are many features like barcode, needsFetchReview without detailed explanation
information. By knowing more details, I can have a better plan to create the data assets.

5.What performance and scaling concerns do you anticipate in production and how do you plan to address them?
One concern I have is the matching rate between two tables. For example, there are not many matched barcode between
receipt table and brand table. I will understand why the macthed rate is low and why there are many barcodes that do not exist in brand table.
